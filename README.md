# Minor Project - A Voice Controlled Semi-Automated Car.

- This is an another IoT project of mine. Here I've learnt how to **interface Bolt with Arduino** and using the principle of Bolt voice controlled lights I've done this project. Using the principle I've tried to create a voice conrolled car. The commands are transferred to Bolt Wi-Fi module over the **Google Assistant** and then those signals are just transfered to the Arduino for the motion or movement of the Robo. 
- I've used an Ultrasonic sensor too, to provide it some automatic movement and stoppage so that the Robo can also be called an Autonomous vehicle too which can make movements on its own too.
